* Whats wrong with "Classic" monitoring systems?
- Shell scripts with success/fail

    #!/bin/bash
    trigger=4.00
    load=`cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1}'`
    response=`echo | awk -v T=$trigger -v L=$load 'BEGIN{if ( L > T){ print "greater"}}'`
    if [[ $response = "greater" ]]
    then
    sar -q | mail -s"High load on server - [ $load ]" recipient@example.com
    fi
- Failure causes alerts
- Machine centric
- aaaaand...

* Nagios, Icinga, Zabbix => Blackboxmonitoring
- Monitoring from the "outside" without knowledge of how your applications works internally.

* Whats wrong with this?

* What do you need to know about your service?
The four golden signals of monitoring are:

Latency


    - The time it takes to service a request.



Traffic


    - A measure of how much demand is being placed on your system.


Errors


    - The rate of requests that fail explicitly and implicitly.


Saturation


    - Measurement of the available ressources.

* Who is Prometheus?
    "Prometheus (blah blah blah, meaning "forethought")[1] is a Titan in 
    Greek mythology, best known as the deity in Greek mythology who was the creator of mankind and its greatest benefactor, 
    who stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to mankind."
